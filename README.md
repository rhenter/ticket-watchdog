## Features

- **Batch ingestion** of ticket events via `POST /tickets`
- **Persistence**: tickets, status history, and alert records in PostgreSQL
- **Background scheduler** (APScheduler) runs SLA evaluations every minute
- **Alert processor**: increments escalation level, notifies Slack, broadcasts via WebSocket
- **Configuration hot-reload**: updates SLA targets on the fly using Watchdog
- **Dashboard API**: `GET /tickets/{id}` and `GET /dashboard?offset=&limit=&state=`
- **Structured JSON logging** with correlation IDs and latency metrics
- **Docker Compose** for local development (Postgres + mock Slack + API)
- **Terraform** scripts for AWS Fargate, RDS, and Secrets Manager

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Terraform (for cloud deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   Using SSH
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rhenter/ticket-watchdog.git
   ```
   Using HTTPS
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhenter/ticket-watchdog.git
   cd ticket-watchdog
   ```

2. Move to the ticket-watchdog folder
   ```bash 
   cd ticket-watchdog
   ```

3. Create your .env file with the environment variables and edit according to your local settings:
   ```bash
   cp env.local .env
   ```

4. Launch services with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Test the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tickets      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '[{"id":"1","priority":"high","created_at":"2025-06-18T12:00:00Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T12:00:00Z","status":"open","customer_tier":"gold"}]'
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Configuration

All settings are managed by environment variables and can be edited in the .env file:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `SLA_CONFIG_PATH`
- `SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
- `API_HOST`
- `API_PORT`

## API Usage

### Ingest Ticket(s)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"id":"1","priority":"high","created_at":"2025-06-18T12:00:00Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T12:00:00Z","status":"open","customer_tier":"gold"}]'
```
**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "priority": "high",
    "created_at": "2025-06-18T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-06-18T12:00:00Z",
    "status": "open",
    "customer_tier": "gold",
    "escalation_level": 0
  }
]
```

### Get Ticket by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/tickets/1
```

### Get Dashboard (all tickets)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/dashboard
```

### WebSocket Alerts
Connect to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/alerts` to receive real-time alert events.

## Cloud Deployment

Terraform scripts located in `infra/terraform/` provision:

- AWS ECS Fargate cluster
- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL cluster
- AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
- ECS service with CloudWatch logs

Usage:
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```
